	<p class="textclass1"> 
	Case of Faure plates, the grid serves simply as a support for the active material and a conductor for
the current and as a means for distributing the current evenly over the active material. Unlike Plante plates, it is not called upon to serve as a kind of reservoir from which fresh active material is continuosly
being formed for replacing that which is lost in the wear and tear of service.</p>

	<p class="textclass2">Hence, this makes possible the use of an alloy of lead and antimony which, as pointed out earlier, resists the attack of
acid and ‘forming’ effect of current more effectively than pure lead and is additionally much harder and stiffer. it is possible to construct very thin light plates
which possess sufficient rigidity to withstand the expensive action of the positive active material.</p>
